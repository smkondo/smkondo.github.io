My classmates from Columbia and I participated in a a desing challenge to create a DIY ventilator out of an ambu bag. The challenge was to create a low-cost ventilator using items easily accessible to the public (household items, cheap 3D printed parts, etc.). The team consisted of students majoring in ME, BE, EE and CS.
