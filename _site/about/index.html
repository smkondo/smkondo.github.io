<p>Hi, I’m Shinya! I am an engineering researcher interested in researching patterns in the natural world and applying them to engineering applications. I am namely interested in investigating the building blocks of fluid flows using reduced-order modeling techniques. I was previously a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Pennyslvania under the supervision of Dr. George Ilhwan Park; however, left the program after two years (my reasoning can be found here). I received my M.S. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Pennsylvania in 2022 and my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Columbia University in 2020.</p>

<p>My main research interests are in computational fluid dynamics and turbulence physics. At Penn, my Ph.D. research was on developing reduced-order models of near-wall turbulence using data-driven and operator driven techniques. In particular, I was interested in using the resolvent formalism to create a reduced-order SGS turbulence model for LES simulations. At Columbia, I conducted research in Dr. Marco Giometto’s Environmental Flow Physics Lab where my research was on creating an analytical model of the wake flow behind a wind turbine.</p>

<p>I enjoy applying research methods to seemingly disparate fields and as such, I am interested in applying my research techniques to other nonlinear dynamical systems found around us.</p>

<p>Outside of research, I enjoy building objects using my 3D printer and recycled material, playing the piano and learning.</p>

<p>I hope to showcase my wide range of interests in this website and I hope you enjoy getting a sneak peak to my jumbled mind.</p>
