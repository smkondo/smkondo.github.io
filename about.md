Hi, I'm Shinya! I am an engineering researcher interested in researching patterns in the natural world and applying them to engineering applications. I am namely interested in investigating the building blocks of fluid flows using reduced-order modeling techniques. I was previously a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Pennyslvania under the supervision of Dr. George Ilhwan Park; however, left the program after two years. I received my M.S. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Pennsylvania in 2022 and my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Columbia University in 2020.

My main research interests are in computational fluid dynamics and turbulence physics. At Penn, my Ph.D. research was on developing reduced-order models of near-wall turbulence using data-driven and operator driven techniques. In particular, I was interested in using the resolvent formalism to create a reduced-order SGS turbulence model for LES simulations. At Columbia, I conducted research in Dr. Marco Giometto's Environmental Flow Physics Lab where my research was on creating an analytical model of the wake flow behind a wind turbine.

I enjoy applying research methods to seemingly disparate fields and as such, I am interested in applying my research techniques to other nonlinear dynamical systems found around us. 

Outside of research, I enjoy building objects using my 3D printer and recycled material, playing the piano and learning. 

I hope to showcase my wide range of interests in this website and I hope you enjoy getting a sneak peak to my jumbled mind.
