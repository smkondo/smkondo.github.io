Hi my name is Shinya! I'm an engineering researcher interested in computational fluid dynamics and turbulence physics. My main research goal is to identify the building blocks of fluid flows to create reduced-order models of complex flow phenomena. 

<!-- ![](/media/profile.jpg) -->

I was previously a Ph.D. candidate in Dr. George Ilhwan Park's [Computational Fluids Group](https://park.seas.upenn.edu) at the Uniersity of Pennsylvania where I worked on reduced-order modeling of near wall turbulnce using data-driven and operator-driven techniques. Prior to that, I was an undergraduate researcher in Dr. Marco Giometto's [Environmental Flow Physics Lab](https://efpl.engineering.columbia.edu) at Columbia University where I worked on an analytical formulation of the wake formation behind a wind turbine. 

I received my M.S. in Mechanical Engineering from the Univeristy of Pennsylvania in 2022 and B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Columbia University in 2020.

Outside of research, I enjoy playing the piano, working on small building projects using upcycled material and learning about the mechanics of swimmers and flyers.
